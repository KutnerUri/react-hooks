short icu guide

https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax

same api for react attributes and children

make sure you have polyfills

cache constructor with ast?

// number (https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/master/docs/userguide/format_parse/numbers/skeletons.md#examples)
date https://formatjs.io/docs/intl-messageformat#datetime-skeleton
select https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax/#select-format
get rid of key for rich text?

// optional component name â€“ return all
// otherwise - componentize

typically structure by components

biggest strength of this library is that it's hooks only. therefore the same API for attributes as well as in children

cache values as well?
separate repo?
